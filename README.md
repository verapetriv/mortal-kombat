## Project description

Two start screens of the Mortal Kombat game have been implemented: 

  1. **Choosing a hero screen.**\
    Two seconds after selecting the second player, you will be taken to the second screen.\
    You can preview the player by: 
      - clicking on the card 
      - clicking on 'ArrowUp', 'ArrowDown', 'ArrowLeft' and 'ArrowRight' buttons
    You can select a player by: 
      - double-clicking on the card
      - pressing the 'Enter' button
  
  3. **Versus screen.**\
    On this page, you have the opportunity to use cheat codes of the QWERTY keys to increase the rating of the players, but only 4 seconds are allocated for this.\
    Cheat codes:
      - 'w' + 'q' - increases your hero's rating by 1 points
      - 'q' + 'w' + 'e' - increases your hero's rating by 2 points
      - 't' + 'r' - increases your enemy's rating by 1 points
      - 'r' + 't' + 'y' - increases your enemy's rating by 2 points

### Have a good game!
